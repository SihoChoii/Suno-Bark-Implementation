I was teased about being a sage, then I got stabbed and died — but I’m not panicking yet; the last time I lost it was in grade school when I crapped my pants; now I can’t see or feel my body, but I’m aware — am I in a cave with rocks and plants? My mouth doesn’t work, but I can dissolve plants — am I dead? What happened to Tamura and Sawatari? A voice answers — it’s my unique skill, Great Sage, which boosts my reaction speed; Predator lets me absorb objects and gain their abilities — so I analyze hipokute herbs (healing potions) and magistone ore (valuable); I fall in water, learn Water Pressure Propulsion, and feel no pain due to Pain Nullification — my body regenerates, which is pretty convenient; then a voice speaks to me — I call it baldy, it’s not pleased, but offers me sight if I agree to visit again; I gain Magic Sense, sense magicules, and finally see — oh yeah, I’m definitely a slime.
