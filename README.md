# üîä Bark Long-form Text-to-Audio Generator

A Python tool for generating long-form audio from text using Suno AI's [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) text-to-audio model. This script automatically splits your text into optimal chunks, generates high-quality audio for each chunk, and seamlessly combines them into a single audio file.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Text Chunking**: Splits text by word count while respecting sentence boundaries for natural-sounding transitions
- **Voice Consistency**: Uses the same voice preset across all chunks for a coherent listening experience
- **Customizable Transitions**: Adds configurable silence between chunks for improved pacing
- **Memory Efficient**: Option to use smaller models for devices with limited VRAM
- **PyTorch 2.6 Compatible**: Works with the latest PyTorch versions

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Bark dependencies

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bark-longform-generator.git
cd bark-longform-generator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the required packages:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git
pip install numpy scipy
```

## üìã Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python bark_longform.py --input your_text_file.txt --output output_audio.wav
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
python bark_longform.py --input your_text_file.txt --output output_audio.wav --words_per_chunk 40 --voice_preset "v2/en_speaker_6" --silence_between_chunks 0.3 --small_models
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--input` | Path to input text file | (Required) |
| `--output` | Path to output audio file | (Required) |
| `--words_per_chunk` | Number of words per chunk | 40 |
| `--voice_preset` | Voice preset for Bark (e.g., "v2/en_speaker_1") | None (random voice) |
| `--silence_between_chunks` | Duration of silence between chunks in seconds | 0.5 |
| `--small_models` | Use small models to reduce VRAM usage | False |

### Voice Presets

Bark supports [100+ speaker presets](https://suno-ai.notion.site/8b8e8749ed514b0cbf3f699013548683?v=bc67cff786b04b50b3ceb756fd05f68c) across multiple languages. Some popular English presets include:

- `v2/en_speaker_1` - Male voice
- `v2/en_speaker_6` - Female voice 
- `v2/en_speaker_9` - Deep male voice

## üíª Example

```python
from bark_longform import process_text_to_audio

# Generate audio from a text file
process_text_to_audio(
    input_file="story.txt",
    output_file="story_audio.wav",
    words_per_chunk=40,
    voice_preset="v2/en_speaker_6",
    silence_between_chunks=0.3
)
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Text Parsing**: The script reads your text file and intelligently splits it into chunks of approximately the specified word count, respecting sentence boundaries.

2. **Audio Generation**: Each chunk is processed by Bark to generate high-quality audio. The same voice preset is used for all chunks to maintain consistency.

3. **Audio Combination**: The generated audio segments are combined with configurable silence between chunks to create a single, coherent audio file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### PyTorch 2.6 Loading Error

If you encounter an error like:
```
_pickle.UnpicklingError: Weights only load failed...
```

This is due to PyTorch 2.6's stricter security measures. Our script includes a fix for this issue. If you still encounter problems, you can try setting these environment variables before running:

```python
import os
os.environ["SUNO_OFFLOAD_CPU"] = "True"
os.environ["SUNO_USE_SMALL_MODELS"] = "True"
```

### CUDA Out of Memory

If you encounter GPU memory issues:
1. Use the `--small_models` flag to reduce VRAM usage
2. Reduce the `--words_per_chunk` value
