# üîä Bark Long-form Text-to-Audio Generator

A Python tool for generating long-form audio from text using Suno AI's [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) text-to-audio model. This script automatically splits your text into optimal chunks, generates high-quality audio for each chunk, and seamlessly combines them into a single audio file.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Text Chunking**: Splits text by word count while respecting sentence boundaries for natural-sounding transitions
- **Voice Consistency**: Uses the same voice preset across all chunks for a coherent listening experience
- **Customizable Transitions**: Adds configurable silence between chunks for improved pacing
- **Memory Efficient**: Option to use smaller models for devices with limited VRAM
- **PyTorch 2.6 Compatible**: Works with the latest PyTorch versions
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Automatically enhances your text with appropriate non-speech sounds and emphasis markers
- **Time Tracking**: Shows progress, elapsed time, and estimated completion time

> Note: For GPU support, you may need to install a specific PyTorch version compatible with your CUDA version. Visit [PyTorch's installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for specific instructions.

4. Set your OpenAI API key (if using ChatGPT enhancement):

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**On Windows Command Prompt:**
```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**On Windows PowerShell:**
```bash
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## üìã Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python bark_longform.py --input your_text_file.txt --output output_audio.wav
```

### With ChatGPT Enhancement

```bash
python bark_longform.py --input your_text_file.txt --output output_audio.wav --non_speech_weight 0.7
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
python bark_longform.py --input your_text_file.txt --output output_audio.wav --words_per_chunk 40 --voice_preset "v2/en_speaker_6" --silence_between_chunks 0.3 --non_speech_weight 0.5
```
The library of supported voice preset can be found here: https://suno-ai.notion.site/8b8e8749ed514b0cbf3f699013548683?v=bc67cff786b04b50b3ceb756fd05f68c

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--input` | Path to input text file | (Required) |
| `--output` | Path to output audio file | (Required) |
| `--words_per_chunk` | Number of words per chunk | 40 |
| `--voice_preset` | Voice preset for Bark (e.g., "v2/en_speaker_1") | None (random voice) |
| `--silence_between_chunks` | Duration of silence between chunks in seconds | 0.5 |
| `--small_models` | Use small models to reduce VRAM usage | False |
| `--force_cpu` | Force CPU usage even if CUDA is available | False |
| `--non_speech_weight` | Weight (0-1) for adding non-speech sounds via ChatGPT | 0.0 |
| `--openai_api_key` | OpenAI API key (optional, can use env var instead) | None |

## üé≠ ChatGPT Enhancement

When using the `--non_speech_weight` parameter (value between 0 and 1), the script will send your text to ChatGPT for semantic analysis and enhancement with appropriate non-speech sounds and formatting:

- **0.0**: No enhancement, skips ChatGPT processing
- **0.1-0.3**: Minimal enhancement with sparse non-speech elements
- **0.4-0.7**: Moderate enhancement with balanced non-speech elements
- **0.8-1.0**: Maximum enhancement with abundant non-speech elements

Supported non-speech markers that Bark recognizes:

- `[laughter]` or `[laughs]` - For moments of humor
- `[sighs]` - For moments of resignation, relief, or exhaustion
- `[music]` - For moments that would benefit from musical emphasis
- `[gasps]` - For moments of surprise or shock
- `[clears throat]` - For appropriate moments
- `‚Äî` or `...` - For natural hesitations or pauses
- `‚ô™` - To surround song lyrics
- `CAPITALIZATION` - For emphasis of specific words

An enhanced version of your text will be saved alongside the audio output for reference.

## üíª Example

```python
from bark_longform import process_text_to_audio

# Generate audio from a text file with ChatGPT enhancement
process_text_to_audio(
    input_file="story.txt",
    output_file="story_audio.wav",
    words_per_chunk=40,
    voice_preset="v2/en_speaker_6",
    silence_between_chunks=0.3,
    non_speech_weight=0.7,
    openai_api_key="your_api_key_here"  # Optional if set as environment variable
)
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Text Enhancement**: If enabled, the script sends your text to ChatGPT for semantic analysis to add appropriate non-speech sounds and formatting.

2. **Text Parsing**: The script reads your (potentially enhanced) text file and intelligently splits it into chunks of approximately the specified word count, respecting sentence boundaries.

3. **Audio Generation**: Each chunk is processed by Bark to generate high-quality audio. The same voice preset is used for all chunks to maintain consistency.

4. **Audio Combination**: The generated audio segments are combined with configurable silence between chunks to create a single, coherent audio file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### OpenAI API Issues

If you encounter errors with the ChatGPT enhancement:
- Ensure your API key is correct and has sufficient credits
- Check your internet connection
- If issues persist, set `--non_speech_weight 0` to skip the enhancement

### PyTorch 2.6 Loading Error

If you encounter an error like:
```
_pickle.UnpicklingError: Weights only load failed...
```

This is due to PyTorch 2.6's stricter security measures. Our script includes a fix for this issue. If you still encounter problems, you can try setting these environment variables before running:

```python
import os
os.environ["SUNO_OFFLOAD_CPU"] = "True"
os.environ["SUNO_USE_SMALL_MODELS"] = "True"
```

### CUDA Out of Memory

If you encounter GPU memory issues:
1. Use the `--small_models` flag to reduce VRAM usage
2. Reduce the `--words_per_chunk` value
