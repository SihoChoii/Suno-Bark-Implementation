I was teased about being a SAGE [laughs], then I got STABBED and DIED — [sighs] but I’m not panicking yet; the last time I lost it was in grade school when I... crapped my pants [laughs]. Now I can’t see or feel my body, but I’m AWARE — am I in a cave with rocks and plants? My mouth doesn’t work, but I can dissolve plants — am I DEAD? [gasps] What happened to Tamura and Sawatari? A voice answers — it’s my UNIQUE skill, Great Sage [music], which boosts my reaction speed; Predator lets me absorb objects and gain their ABILITIES — so I analyze hipokute herbs (healing potions) and magistone ore (valuable); I fall in water, learn Water Pressure Propulsion, and feel NO pain due to Pain Nullification — my body REGENERATES, which is pretty convenient [laughs]; then a voice speaks to me — I call it BALDY [laughs], it’s not pleased, but offers me SIGHT if I agree to visit again; I gain Magic Sense, sense MAGICULES, and finally SEE — oh yeah, I’m definitely a SLIME. [laughs]
