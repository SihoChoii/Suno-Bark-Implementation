My journey toward orthodontics began unexpectedly during dental school when I discovered
something about myself that had always been hidden in plain sight—I have bilateral peg-shaped
lateral incisors and a Class III molar relationship with crossbite. Prior to dental education, I had only
noticed my protruding chin compared to my upper lip. Learning the terminology and concepts
behind my own facial profile in orthodontics class was revelatory; suddenly, puzzle pieces of my
self-image began to fit together. This personal revelation sparked a growing fascination with
orthodontics and soon had me enthusiastically examining the occlusion of friends and family. My
experience exemplifies how education can transform one's perspective and way of thinking—a
theme that has shaped my professional aspirations.
My first meaningful exposure to orthodontics occurred during my sophomore year at the University
of California, Irvine, when I worked for Dr. Yi, an orthodontist who left a lasting impression on me.
Observing her interactions with patients, particularly young adults and teenagers with whom she
developed close connections, I began to envision my future career. Dr. Yi excelled not only
clinically but as an educator, explaining complex tooth movements in accessible terms that engaged
her patients. The positive attitudes her patients developed toward treatment inspired me to become a
dentist who could similarly educate, connect, and instill confidence—someone patients would look
forward to seeing.
During my second year at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Dental Medicine,
orthodontics coursework deepened my interest in the specialty. I was intrigued by the multiple
treatment approaches that could achieve desired results and the dynamic nature of the field. The
continuous advancements in orthodontic technology—from temporary anchorage devices and
implant-supported movements to the increasing utilization of CBCT imaging—reinforced my belief
that education would always be central to orthodontic practice. This knowledge enhanced my
shadowing experiences in the UNLV orthodontic clinic, allowing me to engage meaningfully with
residents about their cases. I aspire to be an orthodontist who remains at the forefront of evolving
research and technological innovations, while educating colleagues to ensure optimal patient care
across the profession.
Throughout dental school, I have actively pursued opportunities to educate others. As a peer mentor
for three years, I found fulfillment in guiding underclassmen through challenges I had previously
navigated. As vice president of the orthodontics club, I coordinated the "study club," where I taught
interested students about advanced orthodontic concepts through research article discussions. My
role as vice president of the Women's Clinic at UNLV SDM allowed me to educate financially
disadvantaged women about oral health while providing free dental care. I extended my educational
outreach by volunteering to deliver oral hygiene presentations to multiple classes of underserved
children at Mitchell Elementary School in Boulder City, Nevada.
My commitment to clinically relevant education led me to undertake research investigating whether
minimal composite repair might be possible with lasers—a project aimed at improving patient
experience. From sample fabrication to data collection and analysis, this research provided valuable
experience that will serve me well during residency. The clear clinical application motivated me to
publish an article on a magazine and present my findings at a national conference, educating others
about potential implications for practice.
Orthodontics uniquely combines my passion for education with clinical expertise and meaningful
patient relationships. The specialty offers the perfect platform to continue my development as both a
clinician and educator. I am drawn to the opportunity to transform not just smiles but also self-
perception and confidence, much as understanding my own occlusion transformed my self-
awareness. As an orthodontist, I will continue my commitment to education—teaching patients
about their treatment, mentoring students and residents, and contributing to the advancement of the
specialty through research and knowledge sharing. Through orthodontics, I can fulfill my aspiration
to be a lifelong educator while providing exceptional clinical care that positively impacts patients'
lives.
